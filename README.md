<h1>In Election Year, Religious Issues and Opposition-Bashing Dominate Primetime TV News in India</h1>

It’s election year in the world’s largest democracy. But even as India readies itself for what is going to be the biggest parliamentary election ever in the history of the world in terms of the number of eligible voters, the Indian media is far from covering itself in glory.

This project is an analysis of eight primetime shows across four of India’s leading English-language television news channels. The story shows that religious issues and targeting of Opposition parties have dominated the discourse on the airwaves so far this election year. 

The constant focus on the Opposition is complemented only by how rare it is for these shows to question the policies and politics of the Narendra Modi-led government instead.

This correspondent analyzed 809 videos across eight different shows on Times Now, CNN-News18, NDTV 24x7 and India Today.

<h2>The Proxy</h2>>

The YouTube playlists of each of the eight primetime shows was used as a proxy for the content on the show. 

However, this gave rise to some interesting methodological challenges.

1. The channels often post more than one video from the same episode. Should the smaller chunks be counted in the analysis?
2. Some channels have a significantly higher number of videos on their primetime playlists than others. How do we adjust this while representing overall data?
3. In addition, should we try and ascertain which ones are the debate clips and then only look at the debate clips or should we analyze every video on the primetime playlists?

Apart from these questions, I also had to set up a rubric by which these videos needed to be classified into themes.

<h2>Potential Improvements</h2>

There are a couple of potential improvements in the methodology I could implement.

1. Based on the durations of the videos, ascertain which video link would have the full debate for that episode. Typically, it would be the longest video added to the playlist that particular day. Then, reduce the dataset to only contain the debates, and subsequently, limit the analysis to what kind of primetime debates are being conducted on these four channels.
2. Use machine learning to conduct the same analysis for the five years between the previous parliamentary election in India (2019) and now. Use precision and recall, and F1 score.
