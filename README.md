In Election Year, Religious Issues and Opposition-Bashing Dominate Primetime TV News in India

It’s election year in the world’s largest democracy. But even as India readies itself for what is going to be the biggest parliamentary election ever in the history of the world in terms of the number of eligible voters, the Indian media is far from covering itself in glory.

An analysis of eight primetime shows across four of India’s leading English-language television news channels shows that religious issues and targeting of Opposition parties have dominated the discourse on the airwaves in election year. 

The constant focus on the Opposition is complemented only by how rare it is for these shows to question the policies and politics of the Narendra Modi-led government instead.

This correspondent analyzed 809 videos across eight different shows on Times Now, CNN-News18, NDTV 24x7 and India Today.
